# usage
Requires (Truffle, NodeJs, Solidity, Ganache (ganache-cli) etc). See Package.json and truffle-config.js 
Contracts not deployed any mainnet or test network. Can use Ganache to run local instance blockchain

Ideal to RESTART GANACHE-CLI before each test due to usage of advances and rollbacks of blocks/blockTimes

Run 2 terminals one for ganache-cli other for commands

```
npm install
ganache-cli
truffle test 
```
